This simulation models how social networks can influence the flow and reliability of information in inquiry.
 
In the model, heterogeneous agents--driven, to varying degrees, 
by the competing priorities of accuracy and of conformity to oneâ€™s peers--share public opinions. 

Agents learn, via Bayesian conditionalization, both from private signal from nature, 
and from the public opinions of other agents.
